emberjs-todo
============
A simple todo list app to experiment with ember.js

**Live demo app:**  http://reinaldo13.github.io/emberjs-todo/

**Things I learned:**
- It didn't take me long to get started (I built the app in just a couple of hours) The documentation was helpful (their docs came a long way... a couple of years ago it was their main weakness). One thing I really liked about the docs is that they also link to the source code so you can see how things really work.
- Ember supports the equivalent to AngularJS components like ng-repeat and ng-class (see how we can change the css dynamically by checking off a todo item)
- There are a couple of areas in Ember that take a bit to get used too, like routing, naming conventions, computed properties etc. But all it takes is to read their corresponding docs a couple of times.

**Next steps:**
- I would like to break this little app into sub-components to experiment with component re-usability capabilities
- Connect to a real REST web service. This app currently uses fixtures to persist the 'todo' items.
